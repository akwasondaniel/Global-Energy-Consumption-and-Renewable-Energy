# Global-Energy-Consumption-and-Renewable-Energy

Title of project
Global Energy Consumption project – How prepared are we to welcome green energy

Source of data
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jamesvandenberg/renewable-power-
generation?select=top20CountriesPowerGeneration.csv

Tools used
1. Google Sheets
2. Tableau (Visualization tool)

Problem statement
An energy company is looking to solve the electric power problem and would want to know the power
demand and possible ways to approach the problem. The following research questions will aid in finding
insight that might lead to answering the problem statement
1. What is the power consumption globally over time?
2. What country consumes the most energy?
3. Does the power consumption equate the power production?
4. What source of power project yields the most energy?

Data Wrangling process
I. Inline with best practices I had to review the data I got from Kaggle.com. I checked for null
values with the filter function on Google sheets.
II. I proceeded to checking for duplicates in the dataset using the year as point of reference. I
ensured that the years were unique across the rows.
III. Also, I checked for consistency of the data and ensured that numerical data were formatted to
number with two decimal points (.0000). This was to accommodate for records with four (4)
decimal points.
IV. I did not use the ‘renewablesTotalPowerGeneration’ sheet from the dataset as it is the same as
‘non-renewablesTotalPowerGeneration’ sheet. Instead, I calculated the sum of the renewable
power generation.


Approach
The approach to this project will first be understanding the performance of power consumption over
time, the various mode of production and the capacity of power they produce. This thought will be
represented in a visualized diagram. Next, this report will show a comparison between the supply and
demand of energy on an aggregated level. Lastly, it will see if there are rooms for improvement and
where to improve.
